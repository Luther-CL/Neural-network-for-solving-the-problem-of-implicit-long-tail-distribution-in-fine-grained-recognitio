# Misclassification-guided two-level partition ViT model for solving implicit long-tailed distribution in fine-grained image recognition



## About file:

1. The filedir which name is "checkpoint" need this two file:

imagenet21k_ViT-B_16.npz

imagenet21k+imagenet2012_ViT-B_16.npz



2. when you use CUB, dog and NAbirds datasets, you can select the partition in filedir which name class. if you need try other datasets, you need get this kind data by yourself.

   

## About environment:

- Python3.7/3.8
- Pytorch1.7.1
- Ubuntu(Not recommended Windows)
- you'd better use GPU
